# SpaceAppsChallenge_Valhalla

This project consists in a retro game styled and inspired by the FIRST INTERACTIVE VIDEOGAME: SPACEWAR!, but with a cool galactic impact twist creating awareness of al the space junk generated.

Instructions:
1. Download the project and unzip it!
2. Go to the DIST folder!
3. Check the SPACE.EXE file and click it!
4. Help NASA in this space mission: Remove space debris!!!
5. Use arrows to move around, charge energy near the sun (without touching it or you will die), grab all the debris you can and complete all the levels! Don't forget to avoid the dead satellites orbiting the earth or you will become space junk too :( !!!

The Game was developed by a young team of tech enthusiast members in python 3, with the Turtle module, in order to code it in a easy, scalable, extendable way.

We hope others could grab our code and make their own version of the game (or other kind of mini-games) and create awareness of this huge problem: SPACE JUNK!
